# White Elephant Gift Exchange Rules

## Game Overview

White Elephant is a popular party gift exchange game where participants can either unwrap a new gift or steal an already-opened gift from another player. The game creates excitement through strategic stealing and the "locked gift" mechanism that prevents endless stealing.

## Setup

### Requirements
- **8 players** (can be adapted for different numbers)
- **8 wrapped gifts** (one per player)
- **Price limit**: $150 per gift
- **Gift type**: Quality gifts that participants genuinely want (not "joke" gifts)

### Before the Game
1. Each participant brings one wrapped gift within the price limit
2. All gifts are placed in a central location
3. Number the gifts 1-8 as they arrive (for tracking purposes)
4. Determine play order by drawing numbers 1-8

## Basic Rules

### Turn Structure

**On your turn, you have two options:**
1. **Unwrap a new gift** from the pile, OR
2. **Steal an already-opened gift** from another player

### The Steal Chain

When you steal a gift:
- The person you stole from must immediately take their turn
- They can either unwrap a new gift OR steal a different gift
- This creates a "steal chain" that continues until someone unwraps a new gift
- **Important**: The chain ends when someone unwraps a wrapped gift

### No Immediate Steal-Back Rule

**CRITICAL RULE**: You cannot immediately steal back a gift that was just stolen from you in the same steal chain.

**Example:**
- Player 5 steals Gift A from Player 3
- Player 3 CANNOT immediately steal Gift A back from Player 5
- Player 3 must either:
  - Steal a different gift, OR
  - Unwrap a new wrapped gift

This rule prevents endless back-and-forth and keeps the game moving.

### The 3-Steal Lock Rule

**Once a gift has been stolen 3 times total (across the entire game), it becomes "locked":**
- The gift permanently belongs to its current owner
- It can no longer be stolen by anyone
- If a gift locks during a steal chain, the chain continues (the victim must still get a replacement gift)

**Example:**
- Gift B has been stolen twice
- Player 7 steals Gift B (3rd steal)
- Gift B immediately locks to Player 7
- The person Gift B was stolen from must still take their turn to get a new gift

## Game Flow Example

### Turn 1: Player 1
- No opened gifts available
- **Action**: Unwraps Gift #3 (Board Game Collection)
- **Result**: Player 1 has Gift #3

### Turn 2: Player 2
- Gift #3 is available to steal
- **Action**: Unwraps Gift #6 (Gourmet Coffee Set)
- **Result**: Player 2 has Gift #6

### Turn 5: Player 5 (Steal Chain Example)
1. **Player 5 steals** Gift #3 from Player 1 (1st steal)
2. **Player 1 steals** Gift #8 from Player 3 (1st steal)
3. **Player 3 steals** Gift #3 from Player 5 (2nd steal)
4. **Player 5 unwraps** Gift #5 (Cozy Throw Blanket)
5. **Chain ends** (someone unwrapped a gift)

### Turn 7: Player 7 (Lock Example)
1. **Player 7 steals** Gift #7 from Player 4 (2nd steal)
2. **Player 4 steals** Gift #1 from Player 6 (1st steal)
3. **Player 6 steals** Gift #7 from Player 7 (3rd steal - LOCKS!)
4. **Gift #7 is now locked** to Player 6
5. **Player 7 unwraps** Gift #3 (Board Game Collection)
6. **Chain ends**

## End Game

### Final Turn (Player 8)
- Player 8 goes last
- After Player 8's turn completes, the game ends
- No one gets an additional "last chance" to steal

### Final Results
- **Every player has exactly one gift**
- **All gifts have been opened**
- Some gifts will be locked, others won't be
- Players keep whatever gift they have at the end

## Strategy Tips

### General Strategy
1. **Going early** means you'll likely get your gift stolen, but you get to participate in steal chains
2. **Going late** means you have more options to steal, but fewer wrapped gifts remain
3. **High-value gifts** tend to get stolen multiple times and lock quickly
4. **Mid-value gifts** might be safer if you want to keep what you unwrap

### Stealing Strategy
1. Consider whether a gift might lock soon (has it been stolen twice already?)
2. Think about whether you're willing to risk having your current gift stolen
3. Remember: you can't immediately steal back what was just taken from you

### Unwrapping Strategy
1. Early in the game, unwrapping is often your only option
2. Late in the game, there may be great opened gifts available to steal
3. If most good gifts are locked, unwrapping might give you something unique

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't want any of the opened gifts?**
A: You must either steal or unwrap - you can't pass your turn.

**Q: Can I steal a locked gift?**
A: No, locked gifts cannot be stolen by anyone.

**Q: What if a gift locks and the person it was stolen from has no gifts left?**
A: The steal chain continues - they must either steal another gift or unwrap a new one.

**Q: Can I steal from the person who just stole from me?**
A: Yes, but not the same gift they just took. You can steal a different gift from them.

**Q: What happens if all unwrapped gifts are locked?**
A: This is rare, but if it happens, you must unwrap a new gift.

## Variations

### For Different Group Sizes
- **6 players**: Use same rules
- **10 players**: Use same rules
- **12+ players**: Consider 4-steal lock rule instead of 3-steal

### Alternative Rules (Not Recommended for Your Game)
- Some groups allow immediate steal-backs (creates chaos)
- Some groups have unlimited steals (games can drag on forever)
- Some groups give Player 1 a final steal opportunity (can be unfair)
